# MoDNS

A modular DNS server where all functionality is provided by plugins.

## Plugins

Plugins are self-contained libraries or scripts which are loaded by the MoDNS server at launch and used to determine how incoming DNS requests are handled.

Plugins implement at least one module. Modules can be one of the following:

- **Listeners** control how incoming packets are parsed into a DNS request (Only one can be enabled at a time)
- **Interceptors** can respond to or drop a DNS request before it is resolves
- **Resolvers** control how outbound DNS requests are handled (Only one can be enabled at a time)
- **Validators** can drop a response
- **Inspectors** get informed of any actions taken by one of the above

For example: A basic DNS caching plugin will implement an *inspector* which will cache any responses generated by the resolver, and an *interceptor* to respond to requests for cached records.

## Interface

The MoDNS server provides a web interface for easy management.
